    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>My name is Santiago LÃ³pez M</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Santiago Lopez Mendez, and I am a mechatronics engineer with
      apassion for designing and developing mechatronic systems. With seven
      yearsof industry experience, I have worked on various projects involving
      software, mechanical, and electronic engineering..
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout my career, I have gained extensive expertise in software
      engineering, particularly in the field of embedded systems. I have
      hands-on experience working with microcontrollers, Arduinos, and Raspberry
      Pi, using C++ as my primary programming language. My proficiency in C++
      development has allowed me to successfully tackle complex projects,
      delivering efficient and reliable solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to my technical skills, I have had the privilege of working
      for international companies, both in the USA and my hometown of Medellin,
      Colombia. These experiences have not only exposed me to diverse work
      environments but have also enhanced my ability to adapt to different
      cultures and collaborate effectively in multicultural teams.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, let me provide you with a summary of my academic background. I earned
      my bachelor's degree in Mechatronic Engineering with honors from
      Universidad EIA. Determined to expand my knowledge further, I pursued a
      Master's degree at Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, specializing in
      Robotics and Automation. During my time as a master's student, I conducted
      research on the manufacture of nanomaterials for protective exoskeletons,
      emphasizing the use of composite aluminum reinforced with carbon
      nanotubes.
